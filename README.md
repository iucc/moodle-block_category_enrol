# Category auto enrollment #

Auto enrol course users which have a specific role into the course category by a predefined specific role.

# Setup #

* When inside a course, turn editing ON, and add this "Category auto enrollment" block to the course.
* Go into the block's settings page.
* Select the `course level role`, which we will be binding this plugin to.
(when every any user is enrolled into the course with this role,
we will be enrolling them also to the course category with another role)
* Select the `category level role`, into which we will be enrolling the user with the course role.
* Save settings and go back to course.

Now, enroll any user into the course with the proper `course level role`,
to see he/she is immediately enrolled on the `category level` with the other role.

Refreshing the course page, you will now see a new link which enables the user
to "Create a new course" on that same category, and also a link
to that category, where all the courses are created.
